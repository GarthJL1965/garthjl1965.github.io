Obviously, [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) Jekyll theme by Michael Rose

## Tools

I use [Markdown Monster](https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com/) to edit the posts & pages. Markdown Monster has a Git client built-in, else;

I use [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) for Git(Hub) Repository management.

I use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) for editing text files - eg .yml configs .. check out Sublime Merge if you're interested in a great merge tool.
