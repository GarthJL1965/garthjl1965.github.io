I love solving technical problems and sharing knowledge and ideas. 

Ever since I was a child I loved playing with electronics - scrounged up PT&T handsets and dynamos, things to make motors spin etc. I have evolved that passion into EDI/Messaging -> Microservices, iOT, and am currently studying a 'blend' of both - Robotics, using a Jetson Nano & ROS (which uses mqtt to send 'messages' to electronic components to have some 'action' performed - run a motor, activate a servo for instance). 

I've learnt the hard way you can't be promoted if you build a niche for yourself - who's going to step into the void you leave ? This has lead me to teach, for example, retrain ex Mainframe programmers, and now (hopefully) blog about things I'm doing and/or have found useful. I've also been a [Codeproject](https://www.codeproject.com/) MVP twice, mainly answering questions/giving guidance in the .NET/C#, C++, Architecture forums.
