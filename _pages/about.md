I love solving technical problems and sharing knowledge and ideas. 

Rewinding to the days when I had hair, was footloose & fancy free ...  I loved playing with electronics - scrounged up P&T handsets and dynamos (to the amusement of the NZ Telecom/Phone techs), things to make motors spin etc. I always kept the passion of 'making things work', and these days, with IOT, messaging, Robotics etc, life holds many more possibilities (still no hoverboard yet). 

Fast-Forward back to reality, I've learnt no man is/should be a silo, knowledge SHARED is power, so here's a blog about things I'm doing and/or have found useful. I've also been a [Codeproject](https://www.codeproject.com/) MVP twice, mainly answering questions/giving guidance in the .NET/C#, C++, Architecture forums.
